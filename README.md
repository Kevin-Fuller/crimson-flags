In the Indiana University Informatics I494 Capstone Class, teams of students were tasked with designing and developing an information system which solves a 'real-world' problem IU students face. My team's system aimed to build a roommate matching web application for IU students that integrates user verification and a personality/lifestyle quiz to match users based on interest.

Crimson Flags was built over the course of two semesters by me and group of 3 other students, each with a different skillset. The first semester was dedicated towards planning (concept, design, database structure, user testing, and ethical implications), while the second semester was reserved for implemenation (database creation, dummy data creation, web-programming, and deployment). Groups were required to use PHP and not permitted to use any form of framework (React, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Etc). Having the largest background in web development, I took on the role of project lead and had a hand in nearly every feature implemented into the web app.
